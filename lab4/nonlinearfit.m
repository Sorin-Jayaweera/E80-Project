
%% Non-linear data fitting. This script demonstrates several techniques
%  for fitting data sets with curves other than lines, calculating the
%  confidence intervals on the fitted parameters, and calculating and
%  displaying the functional confidence bounds and the observational
%  bounds. The data set is take from the data sheet for the TCS10K5 NTC
%  thermistor, which lists the resistance as a function of temperature
%  in degrees C. Since we are fitting the Steinhart-Hart equation to the
%  data, we first converted the temperature to Kelvin. Next, because the
%  Steinhart-Hart equation has T as a function of R, we use T or 1/T as y
%  and R or ln(R) as x. Finally, because the data are so clean, we add
%  noise of Ä…5% to the T data for some of the fits.

% The temperatures.
T = [85.3,73.8,69.2,60,53.1,41.4,25.2,31,27.5,0,19];

% The resistances.
R = [4700,6710,8000,10000,13770,22000,28000,33000,39000,158000,102000];

% The noisy tem[peratures.
TN = T; 


confLev = 0.95; % We set the confidence level for the data fits here.

% Start by working with the original transformed data. We will fit a 1st,

xplot = min(lnR):range/30:max(lnR); % Generate x data for some of our plots.
% The fitting routine 'fit' is particular about the form of the data.
% Use the line below to get your data into the correct format for 'fit'.

% The default for confidence level is 0.95. If we wanted the confidence
% intervals on the parameters for a value of confLev other than 0.95, we

%% Plot 1st-order Fit
